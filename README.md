# TheraCPP

TheraCPP is an educational app designed to teach new programmers how to code and develop programming skills, with a specific focus on the C++ programming language. This app provides users with both fundamental and advanced programming knowledge through entertaining activities, games, and hands-on exercises.

## Overview

The game features 8 chapters divided into 3 difficulties: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. With over 100 levels across these chapters, TheraCPP covers a wide range of programming concepts, guiding new programmers from basic to advanced levels.

### Game Modes

-   **Beginner**: This is the simplest gameplay mode, allowing players to familiarize themselves with the drag-and-drop mechanics of TheraCPP. In Basic mode, players drag coding blocks with action symbols into the gameplay input box to help the character clear the level.
-   **Intermediate**: This mode presents a harder challenge. After getting used to the game's mechanics, players will need to drag and drop coding blocks according to C++ syntax structure into the input box. The code blocks have predefined structures, and players must connect them correctly to solve the puzzles and clear the levels.
-   **Advanced**: The most challenging mode, where players familiar with C++ structure must write the C++ syntax themselves into the code editor to guide the character and clear the levels. The drag-and-drop feature and predefined coding blocks are removed.

### Learning Outcomes

-   **Beginner Mode**: Learn basic coding concepts such as sequences, loops, functions, conditions, and file handling.
-   **Intermediate Mode**: Introduction to C++ syntax, practice and memorize the syntax through more challenging puzzles.
-   **Advanced Mode**: Practice and master C++ syntax by writing code directly.

### Additional Benefits

-   Develop logical thinking by solving various challenges and puzzles.
-   Engage with the TheraCPP world through story dialogues, maps, and interactive gameplay containing diverse mechanics and problems fitting the story progression.
